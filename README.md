## Isomorphic React App Template

Bare bones react app with both client and server-side rendering, using React-Router 1.0.
Managed with npm, built on an express server and sass for styling.

After cloning, from the top directory, do

`gulp`    to build components and css.

and `sudo npm start` to start serving on port 8000.

Please message me any ways I can improve this!
